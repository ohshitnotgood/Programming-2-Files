\section*{Terminologies}
This assignment uses the terminologies as defined in the basic assignment. 

I have replaced some of the original Terminologies in the problem PDF with clearer version of my own.

I make use of the word `pattern' to denote the left-hand side of my description. I call the right-hand side `clue'.

\begin{equation*}
    \underbrace{\texttt{\#\#.\#\#.\#\#\#}}_\text{pattern} \quad \underbrace{\texttt{2, 2, 3}}_\text{clue}
\end{equation*}
Every element of our clue will be referred to as \texttt{clue\_index}.
