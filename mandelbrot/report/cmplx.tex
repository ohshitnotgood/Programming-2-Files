\section{The \texttt{Cmplx} module}
The \texttt{Cmplx} module was implemented to handle complex numbers. For our purposes, complex numbers can be represented using tuples.
\begin{equation*}
     \texttt{c = \{real, imaginary\}}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Adding and squaring two complex numbers}
Trivial implementation that can be achieved by summing the real and imaginary parts (separately). On the instance that we receive 0 as a parameter, for \texttt{sqr/1} we return \texttt{\{0, 0\}}.

\subsection{Absolutes a complex number}
\texttt{abs/1} always returns a number. As instructed, I make use of the \texttt{:math.sqrt/1} module.
