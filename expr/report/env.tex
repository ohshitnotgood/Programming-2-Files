\section{The environment}
In a previous assignment, we have used created an \texttt{environment}, a key-value map. For the sake of inefficiency, we shall trust Jos√© Valim and use the built-in implementation of the \texttt{Map} feature.


\begin{lstlisting}[language=Elixir, caption=For loop that executes each term ]
defmodule Environment do
    def new do
      Map.new()
    end
  
    def new(env) do
      Map.new(env)
    end
end
\end{lstlisting}

And we're a bunch of lazy programmers so we will be using the \texttt{Map.get} function to lookup our elements in our environment.
