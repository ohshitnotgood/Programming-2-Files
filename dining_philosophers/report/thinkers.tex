Our philosophers today are famous internet cats.

Also, instead of implementing our algorithm decentralised first, and then with a centralised `waiter', I did the other way. 

Furthermore, I have flipped the terminologies a bit. What is referred to as strength in the problem PDF is referred to as hunger (as in time until the cat succumbs to hunger) and what is referred to as hunger in the problem PDF is referred here as food. Hunger is replenished every time a cat gets given a pair of chopsticks.
