\section{Problem solved}
At this point, we have already solved our problem. 

But what if the element we are looking for does not exist in the map? Elixir's \texttt{Map.get/3} function allows us to provide a default value which we can take advantage of in situations where we do not require a mapping to take place.

And then it's a series of pipe operations: getting a map result, passing it to the next map, loading the next map, getting the map result and repeat. Following listing provides a snippet.

We can store all the outputs in a list and find the lowest to get the lowest position. Boom, done!
