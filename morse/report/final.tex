\section{Final thoughts}
Finally, as a personal note to Montelius: I had used functional programming before but I used it in multi-paradigm languages which means I got to cheat my way out whenever I needed to. I used to hate recursive programming and think you needed to be gifted or be insane to even start thinking recursively. This course, with Elixir however, has changed all of those views. And I am thankful for that.

Now, I shall begin on a two week rehab period to alleviate myself from functional-programming-withdrawal-syndrome as I go back to working on my personal projects, all of which were written with procedural programming.
