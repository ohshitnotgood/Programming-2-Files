\section{Benchmark results}
Figure 1 shows the time taken to all the elements into a tree (which was pre-populated with 1.000 elements) as the total number of elements in the list grows. Compared are the add time (in red) and the lookup times (in blue)

As can be seen, the graph looks to be ordo $O(n)$ which is different from a traditional $O(\log n)$ of a binary tree. Two explanations for this: a) the benchmark measures the total time taken for all elements to be added (instead of a single element in each iteration) and b) inefficiencies in Elixir pattern matching which may have influenced our results.
