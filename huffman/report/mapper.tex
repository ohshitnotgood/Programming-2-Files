\section{The \texttt{Mapper} module}
The \texttt{Mapper} is a specialised module with two functions: (a) \texttt{max\_pop/1} which returns the character with the most occurrences and \texttt{min\_pop/1} which does the opposite and returns the least occurring character.

Both functions performs a pop operation meaning the item is removed from the map. Returned is a tuple, with a tuple containing the key-value, and the remaining map.
